# About Matt
I am currently a Senior Software Engineer at [TED](https://www.github.com/tedconf). I previously worked on
[Lumen Database](https://github.com/berkmancenter/lumendatabase) on a fellowship from the
[Ford Foundation](https://www.fordfoundation.org) and [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/) at the Berkman Klein
Center for Internet and Society. There I was a [Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) mentor to
two students helping with our projects. I was also a Lead Web Developer at [MAPC](https://github.com/mapc/).
